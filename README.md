Dockerized ETL Pipeline: Loading Jobs from API to Database
Overview
This Dockerized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline automates the process of extracting job data from a specified API, transforming it as needed, and loading it into a database. By containerizing the ETL process with Docker, this pipeline ensures consistent and isolated execution across different environments.

Prerequisites
Before running the Dockerized ETL pipeline, ensure you have the following:

Docker installed on your system.
Docker Compose (if you're using a multi-container setup).
Access credentials for the API.
Access credentials for the target database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Basic knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose.
Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Configuration
API Configuration: Open the config.ini file and provide the following details:

API URL: The URL of the API you're extracting job data from.
API Parameters: Any required parameters for the API (e.g., authentication tokens, query parameters).
Database Configuration: If you're using a separate Docker container for the database, check the docker-compose.yml file. Adjust the environment variables for the database container based on your database's connection details (e.g., host, port, username, password).

Running the Dockerized ETL Pipeline
Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

Build the Docker image for the ETL pipeline by running:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t etl-pipeline .
Start the Dockerized ETL pipeline by running:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it etl-pipeline
The ETL pipeline performs the following steps within the Docker container:

Extract: Connects to the specified API and retrieves job data using the provided parameters.
Transform: Transforms the raw job data into the desired format, applying any necessary data cleaning or preprocessing.
Load: Loads the processed job data into the target database table.
Data Structure
The structure of the data stored in the database after running the Dockerized ETL pipeline will be as follows:

Table Name: [Name of the target table]
Fields:
[Field 1]
[Field 2]
...
Data Schedule
You can configure the Dockerized ETL pipeline to run periodically using a scheduling tool (e.g., cron jobs, Airflow). Decide on the appropriate schedule based on the frequency of updates to the API data and the needs of your analysis.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors while running the Dockerized ETL pipeline, please refer to the error messages in the terminal. If the problem persists, feel free to reach out to [Your Contact Information] for assistance.

Maintenance
As the API or data requirements may change over time, it's essential to periodically review and update this Dockerized ETL pipeline to ensure it continues to function properly. Regularly check for updates to the API configuration, dependencies, credentials, and data transformations to maintain the pipeline's reliability.
